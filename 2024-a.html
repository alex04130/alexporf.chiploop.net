          Who should pay for climate change is an old and unresolved question. Countries argue about who should take the
          blame and how much.
          <br />There's a fascinating video over here detailing the argument and giving some interesting thoughts.

          As we can see from ourworldindata's data, the growth of carbon emissions in newly industrialized countries is
          enormous. China, for example, is currently the world's top emitter, with annual emissions of 11.4 billion tons
          of carbon dioxide. While older industrialized countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and
          parts of Europe. There are many, many different factors involved, such as the accelerated de-industrialization
          of Europe due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the development of newer and better new energy sources.
          Seems like China needs to pay the biggest share of the blame ... Is it?

          The main factor when considering which country is a developed country is GDP per capita, and how can we not
          consider per capita when considering carbon emissions? Developed countries generally have more assets as well
          as more enjoyment. For example, the US has a well-developed aviation industry, etc., which is supposed to be a
          big source of pollution. But the important point is that these countries have so few people compared to
          developing countries. This lowers the total emissions of the whole country. If you divide each country's
          annual emissions by their population, you end up with something like this (same source as the previous table):
        </p>
        <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 60vh"
          src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita?tab=chart&country=QAT~ARE~BHR~RUS~CHN~USA"
          loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none"
          allow="web-share; clipboard-write"></iframe>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">
          In this table, we can see that Qatar, with a very low population, has a staggering <b>37.6</b> tons of
          emissions per
          capita in 2022, and the United States has nearly <b>15</b> tons per capita, while China's per capita emissions
          are
          only a mere 8 tons. Of course, if only consider the emissions per capita, this article would be the same as
          those that only discuss aggregate. <br /></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">
          First of all, if we only consider per capita, then it is not equal for those small countries, because even a
          small country needs to maintain a normal government and other institutions, as well as carry out some
          development. These carbon emissions do not grow linearly, there is a base cost. The smaller the population the
          larger this percentage will be.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem"> The second thing is that talking only about per capita is also hugely
          unequal
          for the big manufacturing countries. The factories of the world provide the products that the world needs, but
          those carbon emissions are counted in the hands of the producing countries. From
          <a target="_blank" class="QuoLink"
            href="http://cf.lcchina.org.cn/docbak/b/8/8/84619_4fffce3aacb88.pdf"><i>中国进出13贸易中的隐含碳估算</i></a> paper, the
          data shows there are nearly 600 million tons of Embodied Carbon emmisions in the trade of China in 2006. It's
          nearly <b>9.2%</b> of the annual carbon emissions of China wchich shows the global industrial cooperation and
          transfers had given certain media outlets some good leverage to demand that developing countries take on too
          much responsibility.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">Finally, it is useless to talk
          only about today's carbon emissions. Developed countries had already undergone industrialization, and their
          past carbon emissions were counted. Those emissions have also contributed to current climate change and they
          have profited from it. They are now able to utilize their post-industrial development to feed themselves and
          even make new energy reforms. But the problem most developing countries now face is to get rich first. That
          was why the problem of development had to be solved by development. The developed countries have already
          experienced economic development, so they can begin to develop the cause of environmental protection. The
          developing countries, on the other hand, are currently facing the real problems of not having enough food to
          eat and not having warm clothes to wear. The most important thing for them is to develop themselves first and
          then solve their environmental problems through the benefits of development. In the final analysis, the
          purpose of environmental protection is to protect the environment on which human beings depend for their
          survival. In the end, it is all about being responsible for people. What is the point of discussing
          environmental protection if people are dying?

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">Looking at the historical totals chart we can see that the UK, which has never
          been on the list before, shows up, because the UK doesn't need to do a lot of emissions
          now through it's previous development. Moreover, the developed countries transfer the high polluting, low
          value-added, and labor-intensive industries to the developing countries. This shifts the
          responsibility from them.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">But these are just arguments. There is no point in arguing. In times of crisis,
          only responsibility remains. So let's see how clean energy is developing in China, the world's largest emitter
          by far. "China is currently outpacing the 3x objective, while other
          countries are lagging behind. "(Page 42, <a target="_blank" class="QuoLink"
            href="https://www.enerdata.net.cn/system/files/publications/global-energy-climate-trends-2024-edition-enerdata.pdf"><i>global-energy-climate-trends-2024-edition-enerdata.</i></a>
          )
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">Overall, climate change is a problem that needs to be addressed by all of
          humanity. It is not the responsibility of one country or a few countries. In this, developing countries can
          pay more attention to environmental protection in their development, while developed countries, because of
          their previous carbon emissions, need to develop better technology for environmental protection as well as to
          assist developing countries in their energy transition and industrialization. Developing countries could
          utilize technology to reduce carbon emissions from development. None of that could be done by one or two
          countries, but was the common responsibility of all mankind.
