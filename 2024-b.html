          Most of the things we come into contact with daily are industrial
          products that have been processed, some of the things are primarily
          processed products, and a few of the things are raw materials. But
          so-called raw materials still have a source.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">
          For example, there is a water pipe, which is made of plastic. There
          are several types of plastics, including natural plastics,
          bioplastics, and synthetic plastics. Both natural and bioplastics
          are derived from biological sources, mainly plants. Synthetic
          plastics originate from the petrochemical industry, where organic
          raw materials for making materials such as plastic resins and fibers
          are extracted from crude oil through cracking and catalysis. Crude
          oil is extracted from land or sea through oil wells. The reason for
          the formation of these crude oils remains a mystery, with some
          people supporting the inorganic oil formation theory and others
          supporting the organic oil formation theory. But none of these have
          an impact on tracing the sources. Organic oil formation is also
          divided into several types, but generally, they are formed from the
          bodies of living organisms, the difference lies in the period and
          method. The source of the living organisms contains the elements of
          the earth and the energy of the sun. And all the elements of the
          earth and the sun also come from nuclear reactions such as hydrogen
          fusion ................... So this kind of traceability can be
          endless, which explains the title: All feedstocks, bio renewables
          included, have to be sourced from somewhere!

          Plastic water pipes are just one example which close to normal life,
          and there are many more such as paper, books, pencils, and so on. An
          important part of these raw materials are biomaterials, which are
          basically derived from plant growth processes. The energy from the
          sun's nuclear fusion is released to the earth in the form of light
          and is received by these plants
          <a target="_self" class="QuoLink" href="#lesson7"><i>(lesson 7)</i></a>. The chloroplasts within the plant use
          this energy to produce
          sugars (e.g. glucose) from the carbon dioxide collected in the air
          and the water absorbed by the roots. These sugars are used to make
          alcohol, vinegar, food, feed, and other human needs.

          Some of the sugars produced by photosynthesis are used to give
          plants energy to grow. The formation layer in the tree grounds this
          energy as well as other elements absorbed by the roots for cellular
          replication. Through these processes of replication, the xylem of
          the tree is produced, which is the source of wood (lesson 7).

          Herbaceous plants are richer in products than woody plants, which
          are primarily used as structural materials. Cellulose, a fiber-like
          biomaterial, is flexible and malleable enough to be used as a
          material for clothing, fabrics, paper, and other products. Global
          starch production exceeds 50 million tons per year, mainly from
          corn, rice, and potatoes
          <a target="_self" class="QuoLink" href="#LRashwan"><i>(LRashwan, 1)</i></a>. This starch is mainly derived
          from the edible parts of plants
          such as fruits, roots, and stalks (i.e. food reserves for ourselves
          and the next generation). Some of this food is eaten by us, some is
          used in industry, such as biofuels, and a large part is given to
          livestock. The meat grown by these animals is then supplied to
          humans. Of course, there are products of both herbaceous and woody
          plants, such as oils, but they are still mainly based on soybeans,
          canola, and so on.

          When talking about growing plants, there are questions about
          organic, eco-friendly, and something else like that immediately come
          up. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
          Nations, more than 700 million people still face hunger
          <a target="_self" class="QuoLink" href="#fao"><i>(fao)</i></a>. This is a major context that can not be
          ignored when discussing
          environmental protection and waste problems. Organic farming that is
          managed well enough is bound to be more environmentally friendly
          than mono-crop conventional farming that focuses only on yield.
          Conventional agro-forestry, with its mono-cropping, the need for
          chemical fertilizers and pesticides and other environmentally
          unfriendly things, and the blow to biodiversity, are all problems.
          But in order to feed everyone, these are the measures that have to
          be used at this moment. Going completely organic may indeed lead to
          completely sustainable development, this contributes to the question
          for all, whether or not to gamble all of humanity or even give up
          some of it now for the sake of nebulous expectations of
          sustainability in the future.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">
          Environmental protection is a necessary thing and people's lives
          have to be good enough too. Then reducing waste and better
          distribution is a part of what needs to be done. Gradually replacing
          traditional agriculture with environmentally friendly agriculture
          and enhancing the efficiency of utilization may be a better option
          that can be obtained at present. Hope someone will come up with a
          solution that will be good enough to address these problems.
